## Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews: Project Overview
In this small project I'm curious to see what reviews say about a nearby ramen shop I frequent. I do basic sentiment analysis and try to extract some basic visuals I think would be interesting to see from text reviews I scrape from Yelp using R.

#### Data Description
This data has been scraped from yelp.com for educational/analytical purposes and consists of 315 observations with one variable: Reviews.
