## [Project 1: Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews: Project Overview](https://github.com/Rlegaspi562/Visualization-of-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Yelp-reviews)
#### Project Goal:
In this small project I'm curious to see what reviews say about a nearby ramen shop I frequent. I do basic **sentiment/text analysis** and try to extract some basic visuals I think would be interesting to see from text reviews I scrape from Yelp using R.
#### Data Description
This data has been scraped from yelp.com for educational/analytical purposes and consists of 315 observations with one variable: Reviews.

## [Project 2: Early COVID-19 Visualization in R](https://github.com/Rlegaspi562/COVID-19-Visualization-in-R/blob/master/notebook.ipynb)
### Project Goal: 
In this project I visualize COVID-19 data pulled on March 17, 2020.
#### Data Description:
The [raw data](https://github.com/Rlegaspi562/COVID-19-Visualization-in-R/tree/master/datasets) pulled and arranged by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE).
##### Findings:
* The number of new COVID-19 Cases are increasing at an exponential rate.
* Whilst China was reaching its apex, the rest of the world was slowly increasing at an exponential rate.
* Politcal decisions and the way countries report its data play significant roles in the increase of new cases.
* At the time of the release of this data, not all countries are hit equally and should observe the rate it is affecting countries such as Italy, Iran, and South Korea.

## [Project 3: Machine Learning to Predict Diabetes: Project Overview](https://github.com/Rlegaspi562/multiple-logistic-regression-to-predict-diabetes/blob/master/_Pt%204%20logistic%20regression%20to%20predict%20diabetes.ipynb)
#### Project Goal:
As an introduction to data science and to apply my currently learned skills, this project was culminated. The goal of this project is to go through the data science life cycle applying fundamental techniques to a subject topic that I've been curious of - predicting heart disease. Throughout this project I use a basic **data science life cycle and ML pipeline**: - Data cleaning - Exploratory data analysis - Hypothesis testing (chi-square / t-test) - Data modeling - Data analysis of results  This project has allowed me to simply apply what I have learned using **multiple logistic regression** model in R. 
#### Data Description:
The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kumargh/pimaindiansdiabetescsv) containing 768 observations/cases and 9 variables as biological characteristics.
